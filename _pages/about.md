My name is Zhihan Zhang (张智涵). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Dr. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). I am currently a member of Dr. Jiang's [Data Mining towards Decision Making](http://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html) (DM<sup>2</sup>) Lab. Prior to my Ph.D. career, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I had the fortune of working with [Dr. Yunfang Wu](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1237/2096.htm) and [Dr. Xu Sun](https://xusun.org/). My recent research mainly focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), Instruction Tuning, Knowledge Augmentation and Text Retrieval.

For my past education and research experience, please refer to [Experience](http://ytyz1307zzh.github.io/experience). For the full list of my publications, please refer to [Publications](http://ytyz1307zzh.github.io/publications) or check my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7dcunDUAAAAJ&hl=en).

-  <img src="../images/new.png" width="25" align=center> Jun 2024: I am joining Amazon as a full-time research intern in summer 2024.
-  <img src="../images/new.png" width="25" align=center> May 2024: One [first-authored paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08711) is accepted to **ACL 2024** main conference! We studied the challenges in cross-lingual instruction-tuning and proposed a simple yet effective method to improve LLMs' proficiency in low-resource languages. Code is available on [Github](https://github.com/ytyz1307zzh/PLUG).
-  <img src="../images/new.png" width="25" align=center> Apr 2024: We released [a new preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14604) on multi-modal mathematical reasoning! We targeted MLLMs' visual understanding capacity for better reasoning accuracy on multi-modal math problems.
-  Feb 2023: I am joining Tecent America as a full-time research intern in spring 2024.
-  Oct 2023: Two papers are accepted to **EMNLP 2023**! These include one [first-authored paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13127) on automatic instruction optimization of LLMs, and one [co-authored paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14457) on language model pre-training for comparative reasoning.
- Jun 2023: I am joining Snapchat Research as a full-time research intern! I will work with [Dr. Francesco Barbieri](https://fvancesco.github.io/) from the [User Modeling & Personalization Group](https://research.snap.com/team/category/user-modeling-and-personalization.html).
