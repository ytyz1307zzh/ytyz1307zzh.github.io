My name is Zhihan Zhang (张智涵). I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Dr. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/). I am currently a member of Dr. Jiang's [Data Mining towards Decision Making](http://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html) (DM<sup>2</sup>) Lab. Prior to my Ph.D. career, I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), where I had the fortune of working with [Dr. Yunfang Wu](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1237/2096.htm) and [Dr. Xu Sun](https://xusun.org/). My recent research mainly focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), Instruction Tuning, Knowledge Augmentation and Text Retrieval.

For my past education and research experience, please refer to [Experience](http://ytyz1307zzh.github.io/experience). For the full list of my publications, please refer to [Publications](http://ytyz1307zzh.github.io/publications) or check my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7dcunDUAAAAJ&hl=en).
